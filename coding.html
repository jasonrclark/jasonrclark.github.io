<h1>Kids Coding</h1>
Several years back I did a lot of active work coding with my kids. Some
writeups and results from that can be found in the <a href="../kidscode">
Kids' Coding Corner</a>.

<h1>Blog</h1>
Infrequently updated but when I blog tech stuff, it shows up here.

{% assign posts = site.categories.coding | sort: "date" | reverse %}
{% for post in posts %}
  <h3><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h3>
  <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span><br><br>
  <p>{{ post.summary }}</p>
{% endfor %}
