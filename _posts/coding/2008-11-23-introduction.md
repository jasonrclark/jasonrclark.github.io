I've already got a blog ([http://blog.jasonrclark.net](http://blog.jasonrclark.net/)), so what's this doing here? Well, I've got an itch to write up some notes on technical issues, things that I encounter during my development days, tips and tricks I find interesting along the way. Given that most of my friends who read the blog are 1) not programmers and 2) have gotten used to not receiving bewildering doses of techie-speak, I decided to set up a separate blog.

I work as an application developer at WebMD, so the stuff I've got slated at the moment revolves largely around web development, databases and ASP.Net in particular.

So there you go. Yet another blog for no one to read but the author.
