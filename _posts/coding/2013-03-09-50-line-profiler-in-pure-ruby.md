Yesterday was another first--my first presentation of any sort at a Ruby conference. I gave a 5 minute lightning talk at [Ruby on Ales](http://ruby.onales.com/), the beeriest Ruby conference around.

[Slides are up](https://speakerdeck.com/jasonrclark/50-line-profiler-in-pure-ruby), [the code is on github](https://github.com/jasonrclark/diy_profile), and there's [even video at around 1:07:30](http://www.justin.tv/confreaks/b/374982906).

This is a massively stripped down version of the talk I'll be giving at [MountainWest Ruby Conf](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/) early next month. It went well, and I'm really excited to run a longer presentation of the material.
