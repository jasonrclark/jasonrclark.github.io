Back in June, I spoke at my second conference, [RubyNation](http://www.rubynation.org/). I'd been waiting a while to post about it until the video was up, but until then [my slides are available online](https://speakerdeck.com/jasonrclark/make-an-event-of-it).

It was an awesome conference, not least for the chance to meet a number of people who I already followed and admire online--[Avdi Grimm](https://twitter.com/avdi), [Sandi Metz](https://twitter.com/sandimetz) and [Steve Klabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik). The Ruby community continues to prove itself as welcoming and friendly as I've always heard it is.

Will update if/when the video gets posted.
