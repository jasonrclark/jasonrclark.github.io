In an earlier post, I mentioned a change that was coming up. Well, the cat is out of the bag -- I'm changing jobs. This is the first move I've made since graduating from college, so it's been quite a big deal. I'm going to be working for [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/) in downtown Portland. Much closer to my home than my old job out in Beaverton.

Additionally, it's going to be almost entirely ASP.NET development, as opposed to the MFC/COM/VB6 client application stuff I've been doing for the past few years. It will also be an opportunity to grow in my database knowledge, since previously I've had only limited exposure to a full database system like SQL Server.

Anyway, not sure exactly what it'll be like or where it'll lead, but it should provide some interesting material to write about. I'm planning to jot down my experiences making the transition from desktop to web, with an emphasis on interesting tidbits I learn along the way.
