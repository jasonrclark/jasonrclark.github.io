After the last couple times I've lost bits of work in progress, I finally decided to bite the bullet and install a clipboard extension. These were brought to my attention via Jeff Atwood's [Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/). He had an [excellent article](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000431.html) about an app called [CLCL](http://www.nakka.com/soft/clcl/index_eng.html). I've installed it, put it into startup on the different machines I use and haven't looked back since. Good stuff.
