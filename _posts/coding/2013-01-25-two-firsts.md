The first first, something I've written is [live on the New Relic blog](http://blog.newrelic.com/2013/01/17/new-relic-ruby-agent-3-5-5-38-come-and-get-it/). Of course I'm also pretty pleased with the feature that it mainly discusses--Thread Profiling in Ruby--which is the first big chunk of code I've written that's shipped so far.

Which actually leads to the next big news... I'll be speaking at [MountainWest Ruby Conf](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2013/ruby-sessions) on Thread Profiling. This is the first talk I've had accepted to a conference, and I'm humbled to be on the same speaker page with Matz and Ward and so many other sharp folks. This time last year, I wouldn't have dreamed that I'd be in this spot.

Working for New Relic is definitely paying off in more than just the day to day!
