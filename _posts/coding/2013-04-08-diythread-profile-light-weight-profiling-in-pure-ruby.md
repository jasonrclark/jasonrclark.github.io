First conference presentation, check! It was a great week in SLC visiting with friends and rubbing elbows with so many awesome Ruby folks. I might post some follow-up thoughts later on, but for now I wanted to be sure to link to my slides. https://speakerdeck.com/jasonrclark/diy-thread-dot-profile

The [ever awesome Confreaks](http://www.confreaks.com/events/mwrc2013) were recording, so at some point a better video than the justin.tv version will be up.
