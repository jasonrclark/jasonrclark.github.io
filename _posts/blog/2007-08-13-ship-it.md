So I've just posted my big high-level recap of pitching at the Willamette Writers Conference. While I finished up editing that, I actually got to the (short-term) finish line, and the partials are in the mail--two hard-copy, one electronic.

Now for that most dreaded of all games... the waiting game. Actually, it takes a lot of the pressure off. I have a bit of final polishing planned for the rest of the book, but otherwise I'm not going to be fretting too much more over it (until such time as someone else points out something to fret about).

Soon I'll start gathering other agents to query, but first there's a pile of closet doors I've been putting off painting the whole summer. They're calling my name, I can hear them.
