I haven't mentioned it on the blog yet, so I guess this qualifies as the first world-wide announcement... Amber and I are expecting!

The due date is March 30, and that puts a significant milestone on Wednesday of this week--the ultrasound. We had two other ultrasounds in the early going, but those revealed only a thumping jelly-bean. I've glad to have seen and heard it, but it doesn't give a lot of personal detail. Wednesday will (hopefully) change that.

Everyone asks whether we're going to find out if it's a boy or a girl. If you know Amber, the answer probably won't surprise you. She has a hard time keeping birthday gifts secret :) It'll be public knowledge as soon as we leave.

Anyway, anticipation is running high. Amber's been quite sick for a lot of the time, but that 's starting to lighten up and now the big ultrasound is on the way. Exciting times.

PS -- To all the folks who would remind me that not everyone finds out, that the baby might not cooperate, etc. I know. Gotta keep optimistic, though, and if not the eventual surprise will be all the bigger and better.
