Just a quick note to announce that my full website, [jasonrclark.net](http://jasonrclark.net/) is finally up and running. Apart from this blog, it includes some of my travel writing that I've made available on the web, links to my favorite writing resources, current reading, links to my favorite technical blogs, and my brewing blog, [The Nervous Brewers](http://brew.jasonrclark.net/).

Check it out and let me know what you think!
