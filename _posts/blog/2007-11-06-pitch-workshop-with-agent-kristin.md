Just a quick post to call out Agent Kristin's currently running [Blog Pitch Workshop](http://pubrants.blogspot.com/2007/10/blog-pitch-workshop-part-i.html). She's breaking down jacket copy line by line, telling what works and what doesn't across the literary spectrum. As I'm in the process of sending out query letters, this advice couldn't be more timely!
