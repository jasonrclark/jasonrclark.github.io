So my beloved wife and daughter are gone for the next week. You all know what that means... writing time!



Now I just need to keep from getting distracted by TV, Wii (must... avoid... unfair practicing at... Mariokart), reading (except gobbling up Watchmen in preparation for the movie), catching up on blogs, twittering, Facebook, tinkering with my website, messing about with photos, reorganizing the office, purging old records from the file cabinet.



Should be a piece of cake. Wish me luck!
