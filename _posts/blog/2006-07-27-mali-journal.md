I talked a little about the trip I took recently to Mali in "[And now for something completely different](/blog/2006/07/07/and-now-for-something-completely-different/)." Finally had a couple people read through, corrected some typos and added a few things, and now it's ready to go. You can check it out at [here](/docs/mali_journal.doc).

My wife also took a bunch of absolutely wonderful photos, and those are at [http://tinyurl.com/ra2nn](http://tinyurl.com/ra2nn). (Went with Snapfish because it has unlimited upload, although getting a sharable URL took a step or two--they really want you to ping everyone with an e-mail from their system).
