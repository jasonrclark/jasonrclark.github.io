As you may have guessed, life has gotten a little busier around the Clark household. However, not all is doom and gloom for something approaching normal life--I have gotten a bit of writing in here and there, and I'm posting over on the [family blog](http://aclarkfam.blogspot.com/) these days since I've got more to write about there than anything fiction/software related.

Anyway, all that to say that if you want to keep up on what's happening with me, the family blog's place to go. There might be [new](http://picasaweb.google.com/amber.d.clark/CoralineSHomecoming) [pictures](http://picasaweb.google.com/amber.d.clark/FirstBath) of Coraline up... shouldn't you be [over there](http://picasaweb.google.com/amber.d.clark) basking in the cuteness?
