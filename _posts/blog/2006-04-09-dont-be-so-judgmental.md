In my last post, I mentioned two different scenes that I was working on, and my belief that one of them was likely to get cut. Well, things don't always turn out the way you expect.



I ran the chapter containing these two scenes by my critique group, and they resoundingly liked all of it--some of the most positive reaction to a chapter that I've had in a long time. It had been a week or two since I had been editing the scene, and listening to their comments on it I could see that my concerns over the scenes being too similar weren't really the case.



It's an interesting situation, and one that needs to be kept in mind when writing--your opinions of a piece when you are in the middle of writing it aren't always necessarily accurate. Getting some space, stepping back for a while before making too many sweeping judgements is a good idea. If I had gone just on the basis of what I thought, I might well have chopped a section prematurely that does build yet another layer to the world of the book.
