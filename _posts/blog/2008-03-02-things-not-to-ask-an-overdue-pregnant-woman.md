No, this one isn't personal experience, but heard through my sister-in-law. Her due date was about a week ago, and things weren't moving along yet. She was, needless to say, antsy to get the show on the road.

Sunday rolled around, so they went to church and were asked--in all seriousness, "So have you had the baby yet?"

To which my sister-in-law replied, "Yes, but we left him home, and I decided to stick a watermelon under my shirt."

I'd say the guy asking that got off easy.
