Last week was a major milestone in my writing--I've finished what at this point appears to be the last major revision on my novel before I start pitching it. There's another polish on the way in the next month before the [Willamette Writer's Conference](http://www.willamettewriters.com/wwc/3/), but the main thrust of that is catching typos from the larger edit.

It's such a great feeling hitting this type of completion point. There's a sense of relief at getting there, since often in the midst of the work it feels like the end will never quite arrive. Along with that comes a touch of melancholy. The time when this book is new for me is coming toward its end. That's premature--it'll likely still be big on my mind and thoughts for at least the next two years, if not more--but it does bring me to considering working on other things.

Life's gone a bit crazy, so it's not a bad time for having finished either. It's been useful to take a couple weeks where to let things sit and focus outside the writing life.

Next step is coming up with the synopsis, and then that'll be the basis for a verbal pitch. Nerve-wracking and thrilling all at the same time!
