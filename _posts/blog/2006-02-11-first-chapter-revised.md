In the past week I've finally gotten down to doing some revisions on the first major chapter of my novel. It has been gratifying to spot places where I can immediately start making the type of world/character building changes that I'm after in this editing pass.



Specifically, the entire first page is getting a rewrite. I've used a couple of sentences from the original, but pretty much dropped and redone it. It's going to need some fine-tuning, but as I've alluded to before, it's important that the story draw the person into the alternate world that I'm creating. The original draft took the better part of a page to reach the point where a reader would realize that strange things are happening. On reviewing it, a lot of what took up that space was things like setting, character description, the main character walking... you know, riveting stuff. I mean, who isn't interested in people walking!



A lot of work remains ahead, but the more I dig into it, the more excited I get about what I'm going to end up with.
