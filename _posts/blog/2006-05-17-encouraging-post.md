Like I've mentioned before, Jonathan Carroll doesn't post a lot of things to his blog about his writing, but I found [a recent post of his most encouraging](http://www.jonathancarroll.com/blog1/2006/05/carrollblog_517.html). It's great to know that one of my literary idols finds himself looking elsewhere at times for pointers, to get in the feel for what he's trying to write.



I've actually had that experience recently. The antagonist POV character in my novel is a creepy guy. I found myself with this undeniable urge to re-read _Silence of the Lambs_ and _Hannibal_, hoping that some of that pure nerve-tingling energy would rub off.
