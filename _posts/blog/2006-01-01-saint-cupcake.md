Just a short note to recommend a cool place to any Portlanders out there. [Saint Cupcake](http://www.saintcupcake.com/) is pretty well exactly what it sounds like--a cupcake shop! A friend brought a bunch of wonderful cupcakes to our holiday soiree yesterday night, and they were great. Beautiful bright colors with sprinkles or coconut... Yummm, cupcakes.



Anyway, if you can check the place out, you definitely should!
