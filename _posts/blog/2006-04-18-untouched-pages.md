It's such a nice feeling when you're editing away, tearing your "masterpiece" to pieces, dropping whole chapters left and right and suddenly you reach a page that just works. No nasty blue-ink scribbles. No arrows to other parts of the sheet where you've got enough room to enact the changes. Just crisp white paper with black letters printed on it.



Haven't seen too many of those lately, but I found a patch in my most recent chapter that I read through, liked, and left just the way it was.



No such luck on the rest of the chapter, but you've got to start somewhere.
