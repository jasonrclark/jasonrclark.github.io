In the time since I last blogged, a [lot](http://aclarkfam.blogspot.com/2010/10/coming-next-april.html) [has](http://nerd.jasonrclark.com/2012/10/new-relic-week-1.html) [happened](http://solipdx.com/). Another big item on the list is that I started biking.

I've never been much of a fitness person, but this change had its roots in our family bikes. We purchased family bikes in the summer of 2010 to help us keep healthy and get out in the evenings. Unfortunately, the first few rides threw Amber's back out. My inner cheapness came to the fore then, as I looked at the bikes waiting there, unused. I decided I'd cycle to work, at least a few times, so they wouldn't just be stalled on the porch.

I fell in love.

Since then time, I've traded in my lovely 7-speed hybrid for a full road bike (thanks Andrew!), wrote [a website for tracking my stats](http://cycling.robotlikes.com/), started obsessing over [my Strava segments](http://www.strava.com/athletes/523998), and [ridden over 5000 miles](http://cycling.robotlikes.com/).

Along the way, I started to participate in longer organized rides. With that in mind I'm going to start jotting down my thoughts on the events, in large part to keep track of things myself, but maybe someone else will get useful ideas about rides to join in on around the Portland area.
