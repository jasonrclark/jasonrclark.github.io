I've decided to do is make a list of issues that have been coming up in critique group. Most of these are related to grammar and diction--certain patterns that I overuse and a tendency to use a big word when a diminutive one would suffice :) I'm hitting the point where it's hard to keep track of all the things that have been pointed out before. This should help since I don't want to hear the same problem over again, no more than the group probably wants to read the same problem repeatedly!



Anyway, I've got a Backpack page, and whenever I notice a particular comment being made multiple times I'll be adding it to the list. Then I'll do at least one pass through new chapters with the list in hand. Hopefully this will help me to be more aware of the persistent issues, and gradually they'll disappear to be replaced with new, different problems.



Word Delta: -550 editing changes (haven't done "the list" pass yet).
