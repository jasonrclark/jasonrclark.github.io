An unspoken part of the distance riding scene is the fact that it starts early.
This makes a lot of sense given that most of the rides are in summer when the
midday heat can be a problem. The more of the ride you get done before noon the
better.

The [Harvest Century](https://orbike.com/hc/), as one of the latest rides of the
season, is pretty chilly to start but this year the foggy views kind of made up
for it.

I first rode the Harvest Century 2011 on a rented road bike (I'd just started
with my hybrid which I would soon replace with my trusty Cannondale). Since then
the ride has moved its starting point from Hillsboro to Canby, although some
bits of the ride still overlap. One common point with many Portland area
centuries is a stop off in Champoeg State Park. My family showed up there this
year to cheer me on in old-fashioned style.

Although the hills weren't as intense as the Ride Around Clark County 2024,
there was still plenty of climbing. [I'm happy with my
time](https://www.strava.com/activities/12420823827) although my rear-end sure
wishes my times were closer to the 6 hour marks I used to be capable of.

Here's to a season of biking in the books. Bring on the next!
