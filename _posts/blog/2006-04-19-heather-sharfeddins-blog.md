One of the writers in my critique group has started a blog that is well worth checking out:

Heather writes contemporary western fiction, and her second novel, _Mineral Spirits_ will be coming out later this year. Although not my typical genre, everything I've read from her has been top-notch. The characters and stories really grab your attention, making it unimportant exactly where the book would be in the bookstore.



She's also started doing a series where her agent, Robert Brown, has agreed to [answer questions from aspiring authors](http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-tYGPJN45aK5E9Tjz6iXbinRcaA--?cq=1&t=t&amp;p=20). Cool stuff, check it out.

UPDATE: As of fairly recently, Heather's blog (which had moved anyway) has shut down. She accidentally deleted it, and a spammer hijacked the name. Stink! You can still check out her website, though, [http://www.heathersharfeddin.com/](http://www.heathersharfeddin.com/)
