Apologies to anyone who missed out on my lack-of-blogging for a bit. My good friend Michael who hosts my site was switching servers, and the wires got crossed on a few things for a bit.

The main site is still down until I make a few changes, but the blog and the [brew blog](http://brew.jasonrclark.net/) should be back in working order.

Ah, now I can relax and carry on not blogging much :)

Update: Main site should be back up--peeled it back to .Net 1.1 since I don't know if/when we'll get an upgrade. Don't love it, but there you go.
