So after secretly laughing at me for having two [separate](http://blog.jasonrclark.net/) [blogs](http://brew.jasonrclark.net/), my wife finally caved and created her own outlet on the internet: [Everything's Coming Up Clark](http://aclarkfam.blogspot.com/).

This will be the go-to source for all things Clark family related--baby pictures, news and ramblings when the time comes, notes on the remodel, dog-thoughts, and whatever else Amber feels like jotting down. If you like keeping up on that type of thing, it's the place to be!

And as an added bonus, my wife is [freaking](http://aclarkfam.blogspot.com/2008/01/personal-freakisms.html) [hilarious](http://aclarkfam.blogspot.com/2008/01/treatise-on-breakfast-sandwiches.html)! Check it out.
