After many years of dreaming it finally happened--I've started brewing with my good friend Andrew. As a beer lover, the idea of crafting my own brew has always appealed both for building an understanding of how it's made and enjoying the results. Plus, who could resist the call of harnessing millions of wee-yeasties to do my bidding!  
  
Between a gift certificate that Andrew got and my own birthday present from my lovely wife, we were finally set in October. Our first attempt was a porter, and I suggested we call it "Passable Porter"... assuming it was passable. I'll ramble more about the process and details later, but we came out with something drinkable, which was more than I expected from a first batch.  
  
From there, we've got a West Coast stout sitting in the primary, and plans to use a Trappist ale kit that Andrew received for Christmas this weekend. All in all, we're off to a great start.  
  
I'll be inviting Andrew to write here too, and we'll record the trials and travails as we learn the ins and outs of making that most potable of potables--beer.
