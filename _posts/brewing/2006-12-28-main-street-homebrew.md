When delving into the mysterious world of brewing, contradictory information is the norm. The newbie needs a guide, to point out the right direction, reveal the pitfalls and simply calm the nerves.  
  
For us, that position is amply filled by [Main Street Homebrew](http://www.mainbrew.com/). Not only does the shop provide the specific supplies and kits that are such a boon to new homebrewers these days (I can't imagine brewing back before homebrew shopes were common!), it's a source of excellent advice. When we purchased the goods to make our first batch, Kevin, Main Street's owner, walked us through each step of the instructions. Although I'd already read a book on the subject, having that personal direction was great.  
  
If you're in the Portland metro area, I highly recommend Main Street Homebrew. Even if you're not, you'll find a wealth of good, reliable information on their website. Check out the [Information page](http://www.mainbrew.com/pages/infosplit.html) for a start--I found the bottling article to be particularly useful.
