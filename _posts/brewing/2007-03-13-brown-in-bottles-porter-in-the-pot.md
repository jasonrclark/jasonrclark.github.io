Although the blog may have gone quiet for a bit, the brewing certainly hasn't around here. This past weekend we started up our fifth batch--a redux on the initial porter, which we badly botched since we didn't add enough water back.

Our last effort, the brown, has been in bottles for a couple weeks, but hasn't gotten the real taste-test yet. The first sip we took at bottling time was okay, and has us wondering what the end product will taste like. However, time does a significant amount to change the character of any home-brewed beer, so I'm still hopeful.

The past month or so of sitting has done a lot to enhance the Trappist-style ale. A lot of the sharpness has worn off. It has a significantly fruity taste, a sweet bubble-gum/banana smell (which is the hallmark of this type of brew), and only a bit too much hoppy bitterness that's out of the ordinary.

More brewing stories here to come, but for the moment I'm just going to savor the sound of the porter bubbling away in the next room. Ahh, it's like beautiful music.
