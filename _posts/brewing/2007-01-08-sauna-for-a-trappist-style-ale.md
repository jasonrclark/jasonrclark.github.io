As noted previously, we moved the primary fermenter into the bathroom to get some good heat going for it. Man did that work! Within a few short hours the space heater had pumped things up to about 75-80 degrees, and the beer went from bubbling every 25 seconds or so to a nearly constant 5 second clip.

This kept up for about a day and a half, then dropped off precipitously. This was a familiar phenomena from the first brewing batch, where in a short span of time things seemed to go entirely (and eeriely) dead. The reality is that the sugars just ran out, so the yeast were finished.

The Trappist-style ale has moved over to the secondary for its nice, couple week settle, and then into the bottles.
