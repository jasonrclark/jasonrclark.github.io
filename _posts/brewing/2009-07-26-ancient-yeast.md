Just a quick link to a story I read in Wired. Apparently, a scientist has harvested yeast from an insect trapped in amber, and they're making a beer out of it. Very interesting, hoping I'll be able to find it to get a taste.

In other news, have an Amber Ale and a Scottish Strong Ale in the secondary. I'm feeling a whole lotta bottling coming on.
