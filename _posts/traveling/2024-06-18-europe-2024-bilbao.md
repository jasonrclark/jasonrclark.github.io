Our flight out of Dublin was uneventful, bringing us to Bilbao and the
Continent. At the airport we gathered our bags and rolled to an infrequently
visited part of Spain for us -- the car rental desk. Amber had a reservation all
lined up, and so in relatively short order we were in the parking garage. The
vehicle we'd be using for our jaunt across Spain was nearly the biggest one
available... so just a mid-sized hatchback.

Bilbao was much greener and hillier than the parts of Spain that we were used
to, but no less humid for all that. We drove into town, located where we would
be staying, and then circled until we found a cramped parking garage drilling
down into the earth.
