Our flight out of Dublin was uneventful, bringing us to Bilbao and the
Continent. At the airport we gathered our bags and rolled to an infrequently
visited part of Spain for us -- the car rental desk. Amber had a reservation all
lined up, and so in relatively short order we were in the parking garage. The
vehicle we'd be using for our jaunt across Spain was nearly the biggest one
available... so just a mid-sized hatchback.

Bilbao was much greener and hillier than the parts of Spain that we were used
to, but no less humid for all that. We drove into town, located where we would
be staying, and then circled until we found a cramped parking garage drilling
down into the earth.

Our accommodations in Bilbao were at the Santiago Apartments. As the name
suggests, it was more apartment than hotel, with a small kitchen, two bedrooms
(Cora slept on the fold-out couch in the living room), and most importantly
a washing machine. For the extended trip we packed only about 5 days worth of
clothes, so having routine stops with laundry was a key element of the plan.

The evening we met up with one of my former coworkers from New Relic, Iker. He
gave us a walking tour of parts of Bilbao on our way from the apartment to
dinner. He quizzed the kids, with little success, about who the _second_
president of the United States had been. Of course they know about George
Washington, but what happened after was hazier. The reason for his question
became clear when we passed a statue of John Adams, who apparently had visited
the Basque country in the 1700s to learn about their governmental systems.

Dinner was at a place called
[Kokken](http://restaurantekokken.com/index_english.html). I hadn't realized
when we were choosing, but it was a "surprise" restaurant, with a fixed but
reasonably priced menu. This turned out to be a big challenge for our kids.
They're relatively adventurous eaters compared to many of their friends, but
seafood represents the edge of their comfort zone. Given that, the large cubes
of tuna with chorizo sauce and cuttlefish in teriyaki were a lot to ask. As is
our usual practice, we offered them cold hard cash for trying bites. They made
out like bandits.

The pinnacle of the evening was when a dish with sweetbreads. Those in the know
are aware that these are the thymus, but we'd misunderstood it to be, ahem,
testicles. The furor after informing the kids what we thought they'd tried was
worth the vexation and price of entry. I think the kids may never trust us
offering foods that they can't identify the ingredients of again.
