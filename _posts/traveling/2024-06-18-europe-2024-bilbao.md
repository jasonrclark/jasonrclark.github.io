Our flight out of Dublin was uneventful, bringing us to Bilbao and the
Continent. At the airport we gathered our bags and rolled to an infrequently
visited part of Spain for us -- the car rental desk. Amber had a reservation all
lined up, and so in relatively short order we were in the parking garage. The
vehicle we'd be using for our jaunt across Spain was nearly the biggest one
available... so just a mid-sized hatchback.

Bilbao was much greener and hillier than the parts of Spain that we were used
to, but no less humid for all that. We drove into town, located where we would
be staying, and then circled until we found a cramped parking garage drilling
down into the earth.

Our accommodations in Bilbao were at the Santiago Apartments. As the name
suggests, it was more apartment than hotel, with a small kitchen, two bedrooms
(Cora slept on the fold-out couch in the living room), and most importantly
a washing machine. For the extended trip we packed only about 5 days worth of
clothes, so having routine stops with laundry was a key element of the plan.

The evening we met up with one of my former coworkers from New Relic, Iker. He
gave us a walking tour of parts of Bilbao on our way from the apartment to
dinner. He quizzed the kids, with little success, about who the _second_
president of the United States had been. Of course they know about George
Washington, but what happened after was hazier. The reason for his question
became clear when we passed a statue of John Adams, who apparently had visited
the Basque country in the 1700s to learn about their governmental systems.

Dinner was at a place called
[Kokken](http://restaurantekokken.com/index_english.html). I hadn't realized
when we were choosing, but it was a "surprise" restaurant, with a fixed but
reasonably priced menu. This turned out to be a big challenge for our kids.
They're relatively adventurous eaters compared to many of their friends, but
seafood represents the edge of their comfort zone. Given that, the large cubes
of tuna with chorizo sauce and cuttlefish in teriyaki were a lot to ask. As is
our usual practice, we offered them cold hard cash for trying bites. They made
out like bandits.

The pinnacle of the evening was when a dish with sweetbreads. Those in the know
are aware that these are the thymus, but we'd misunderstood it to be, ahem,
testicles. The furor after informing the kids what we thought they'd tried was
worth the vexation and price of entry. I think the kids may never trust us
offering foods that they can't identify the ingredients of again.

The next morning we had breakfast at a typical little Spanish cafe. The menu was
such a nourishing return to things we love and miss in the states -- multiple
different tortillas, bocadillos with jamón, cafe con leche. We ended up
returning to the spot every morning of our visit because it was just the thing.

Our location in Bilbao had been largely chosen because of how close it was to
the main attraction of the city, the [Guggenheim
Museum](https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/en). For those not big in the art
scene, the Guggenheim is one of the most famous and respected museums for modern
art in the world. I went in knowing basically only that, and it was a great day
of learning and reflection.

Upon entering, one of the first large exhibits was a work titled ["The Matter of
Time"](https://www.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/en/the-collection/works/the-matter-of-time).
This enormous set of sculptures is made from from weathered steel that was aged
to give it fascinating colors and textures. A smaller room off the exhibit
showed off a scale model of the work with lots of detailed wall hangings
describing its construction.

The whorls and angles of the whole thing are mysterious and engulfing, with
several sections that you walk into without being able to see where it will
lead. It's so huge that Asher was free to dash around, while the rest of us
moved at a slower, more thoughtful pace.

Being modern art, there was a wide variety of different works. Some looked dark
and moody, introspective and spare. Others were bold and bright, often whimsical
even.

A nice aspect of traveling with teenagers now was that we were able to split up
a bit and proceed at our own paces. Asher, as you might expect if you know him,
did something of a speedrun. Cora, who's been digging deep into art at school
and home, took a more meditative pace.

It was really fun to spend the time there, especially with Cora, and see her
experiencing just how broad the world of art can be.

On our way back towards the apartment in early afternoon, we were also on the
prowl for food. We happened to see [Porrue](https://www.porrue.com/?lang=en).
This had been one of the other options that Iker had mentioned, although it was
quite a bit more upscale so we'd hesitated about it for the kids in an evening.
Lunchtime, though (2pm is totally lunchtime in Spain)? Seemed worth trying. This
proved to be an awesome choice.

The meal got off to a start with a feature that amazed and delighted our
children. It's common practice to provide a little bread and olive oil to start
a meal, but this rocketed to the next level. They wheeled over an entire cart
with multiple different types of bread and olive oil to choose from. The flavors
really showed off the range that olive oil can take. Some were peppery, some
fresh, all of them delicious. The waiters seemed quite pleased with the kids'
excitement, and it was hard work getting them to slow down before the actual
meal.

Soon after came a tomato salad, so simple but so delicious. Again, the olive oil
was key, but these were also clearly from-your-garden level tomatoes.

Among the most dynamic parts of the meal was the "Sliced Bellota Jamón with
salmorejo and regañá crushed with mallet." This most favorite of Spanish
products came with the creamy salmorejo (tomato soup) and on top of a shell of
cracker-like bread that you smack with a mallet to break into pieces.

Very traditionally Basque, we ordered the chuleton, a big hunk of lovely beef
cooked to perfection. It comes along with a little grill that you can use to
sizzle the pieces further to your own taste. I appreciate this approach, as they
send you the steak perfectly prepared and if you want to ruin it by going well
done, that's your own doing.

I'm a huge fan of seafood, and Spain always delivers. Here I was able to have
percebes, also known as goose beck barnacles. These also came on their own
grilled with special tooling to pry the salty little nuggets of goodness from
their admittedly odd shaped shells. The kids tried them, were unimpressed, and I
had to step up as the family goat (in the barn animal cleaning up, not the
greatest of all time 😜) on this round.

I don't often seek out wine, but for this nice of a meal it seemed a waste not
to let them pair things. So many delicious whites and tintos! They also served
us a house aperitif at the end. I love the way that in Spain it's common for
places to have their own vemuts or other tasty beverages that are steeped in
house, utterly unique in their local blend.

The meal had many other courses, including the porrue (leek) which is very
traditional in the Basque country, mushrooms with egg, steak tartare. There was
no lunch menu, and this was our most expensive meal of the whole trip but such
a revelation to the kids of how creatively food can be done. Utterly stuffed
both in our minds from art and our stomachs from the meal, we crashed back at
the apartment and rested the remainder of the day.
