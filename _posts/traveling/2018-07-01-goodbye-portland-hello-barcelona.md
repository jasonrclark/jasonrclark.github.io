Through a series of wildly unexpected occurrences, the Clark family is moving to
Barcelona, Spain! New Relic has an office, which made obtaining work in another
part of the world so much easier.

Why are you going you might ask?

- Both of our kids have been in Spanish immersion at school, which has been
  fantastic. We want to see that immersion deepen and include us too, so moving
  to a Spanish speaking country seemed like just the ticket.
- Amber and I have both had wonderful, life-shaping experiences in living
  overseas. This was an un-missable chance for us to give our kids the same
  opportunities.
- A variety of tough circumstances around our house have left us in a spot where
  we had to rent. Ask me about it over beers/whiskey sometime and I'm happy to
  share... bottom line, we found ourselves needing to rent, so why not rent in
  Barcelona.

There are a number of common questions that come up too:

- **When do you go?** Hopefully July 22. Look for more news in this space.
- **Where will you live?** We don't know exactly--we'll be finding housing in
  the first weeks after we get there, but we're aiming for walking distance from
  New Relic's offices downtown in
  [Eixample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eixample).
- **What about schools?** That's still also up in the air, but with the kids
  already speaking Spanish we're confident we'll find a good place for them,
  even if it entails ramping up on
  [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language).

We'll be using this blog for posting some stories and pictures from our travels
since not everyone shares the same social networking sites these days. I hope
you'll join us!
