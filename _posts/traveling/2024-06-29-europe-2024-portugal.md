## Lisbon

For years we'd heard great things about Portugal. Finally it was time to check
it out for ourselves!

{% include image.html caption="Steep hillside with houses in Lisbon" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/lisbon.jpg" %}

We took a cab from the airport per usual. At the end of the ride we got our
first hint of a problem we'd struggle with across this leg of the trip. The
driver insisted there was an extra fee per passenger which hadn't been mentioned
before. But we were tired from the flight, so rather than fight, we rolled with
it. Turns out, weird stuff like this kept happening with cabs unless we ordered
them on a service like Bolt. Word to the wise, make sure the meter's running.

The neighborhood where we'd rented an apartment was a little rundown but nothing
troubling. We schlepped our luggage upstairs in the tiny elevator. Everything
was in place, including a little garbage can beside the toilet and prominent
signs in multiple languages informing that you couldn't flush the TP. What?
Really? In Europe? This turned out to be common where we went in Portugal, not
just a fault of this building's plumbing.

Another hurdle in Lisbon -- quite literally -- were the many many hills. We're
very accustomed to walking when we're traveling. A quick glance at the map often
looked reasonable to avoid the cabs. Almost without fail, though, more than a
couple blocks would yield steep stairs climbing skyward, hills with charming if
ankle-threatening cobblestones, and a sheen of sweat by the time you arrived.

## Tiling

Lisbon was, on the whole, a colorful city. A lot of architecture was vaguely
similar to Barcelona, but with more bright paint livening it up.

{% include image.html caption="Building with green tiles and a rounded end" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/tiling-building.jpg" %}

Even more distinctive, though, was Portugal's typical tiling. While not every
building was fronted with various tile patterns, almost any walk you'd see at
least a couple. In some areas, the tile included images amongst the artistic
geometry.

{% include image.html caption="More pictorial tiling" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/tiling-murals.jpg" %}

The tiles were common enough, they showed up even in the tourist shops for
purchase. Given that Lisbon seemed a little run down at times, this use of tile
was a cool counter-balance to what could have been a dreary urban setting.

## Castelo Sao Jorge

In the city, one of the major sights was the [Castelo Sao
Jorge](https://castelodesaojorge.pt/en/), crouched on the hilltop. On our second
day, we started the hike up to it. Small carts with padded seats kept zipping by
us, bringing folks to the castle. Less than halfway up we broke. When an empty
cart asked if we wanted a ride, we said sure and hopped on.

{% include image.html caption="View of the city from Castelo Sao Jorge" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/palace-views.jpg" %}

In the outer courts of the castle, an immediate point of interest was the
plethora of peacocks roaming free.

{% include image.html caption="Peacocks at Castelo Sao Jorge" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/peakcocks-about.jpg" %}

It had been a while since we'd eaten when we arrived, so we grabbed food from a
little outdoor cafe inside. This gave us a chance to watch the peacocks. They
watched us closely in turn. Hovering endlessly around the area, they clearly
expected a hand-out we were quite willing to provide.

{% include image.html caption="Asher feeding the peacocks" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/peacocks-feeding.jpg" %}

The castle contained a museum. Along with that, it also had a camera obscura in
one tall tower. While I associate these assemblies of lenses and mirrors to
project images with the distant past, this one was only installed in 1998! Still
a pretty cool view of the city, though.

{% include image.html caption="Lisbon through the camera obscura" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/palace-camera-obscura.jpg" %}

As we were getting ready to go, there was a long set of stairs running downward,
the final destination not visible from the top. Asher really wanted to see if it
was an exit, even though it wasn't marked as one. The gals stayed smartly up
top, but I trooped down with my energetic son, and guess what? It wasn't an
exit. We climbed back up.

{% include image.html caption="Asher wanted to see where the stairs went" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/asher-on-the-stairs.jpg" %}

## Sintra

Our one big day outside of Lisbon took us to the town of Sintra. There we
visited not one but two interesting spots -- the [National Palace of
Pena](https://www.parquesdesintra.pt/en/parks-monuments/park-and-national-palace-of-pena/),
and the [Moorish
Castle](https://www.parquesdesintra.pt/en/parks-monuments/the-moorish-castle/).
We booked a driver through Bolt at a reasonable price, even going between towns
in this fashion.

{% include image.html caption="National Palace of Pena" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/palace.jpg" %}

The Palace was rather busy, with timed entry for folks, long lines for the buses
that made the final approach, and people everywhere. However, it was an
impressive sight perched up on the hill, with bright yellow walls and
complicated stonework everywhere.

{% include image.html caption="Crowded exterior at the National Palace of Pena" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/palace-crowds.jpg" %}

The Palace was very much not an ancient castle, "only" dating from the 1850s.
This was evident in the size of many of the spaces, which were actually rather
spacious. It also showed up in the frequency of bathrooms, which must have been
a luxury innovation at the time. The interiors were lushly decorated and a lot
of fun to tour through.

{% include image.html caption="Dining room at the National Palace. We weren't
invited to stay." url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/palace-interior.jpg" %}

As we'd seen elsewhere, patterned tiling was all over the National Palace.

{% include image.html caption="Tiled courtyard" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/palace-courtyard.jpg" %}

Downhill from the National Palace was the Moorish Castle. This was a much older
structure, falling apart in many areas. We walked down to it through deeply
forested hillsides.

{% include image.html caption="Woods near Sintra" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/woods-by-the-castle.jpg" %}

The day was rather cool at the higher elevation. At the castle that didn't get
much better as the winds whipped through with little of the castle body to block
the breeze.

{% include image.html caption="Tree growing within the castle" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/tree-in-the-castle.jpg" %}

Perched as it was on a hill, the Moorish Castle used its surroundings to good
effect. This meant that the walls were nothing like a simple flat rectangle.
They swooped up and down in either direction, following the folds of the
hilltops.

{% include image.html caption="Stairs down" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/castle-more-stairs.jpg" %}

{% include image.html caption="Stairs up" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/castle-stairs.jpg" %}

All the climbing was worth it for the stunning view from the highest points.

{% include image.html caption="View from the Moorish Castle" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/castle-view.jpg" %}

After we caught a Bolt back to Lisbon, we had it drop us off at the [TimeOut
Market](https://www.timeout.com/time-out-market-lisboa/restaurants). We got
there late enough the market was largely shut, but a huge open space was devoted
to food vendors. We all got to pick what we wanted. Following my meal, I tried
out a sampler of different ports which was lovely. The rest of the family took
advantage of the gelato situation available. A massive screen in the center of
the tall tables was showing the European Championships (~~soccer~~ football,
France versus Belgium while we were there, so no one got too rowdy.)

## The Food

As ever, a big part of our time in Portugal revolved around food. We scheduled
to take a cooking class. It started with a trip to the [Mercado 31 de Janeiro
market](https://informacoeseservicos.lisboa.pt/contactos/diretorio-da-cidade/mercado-31-de-janeiro)
where our instructor showed us a variety of local vegetables and meats, and
gathered up what we'd need for the class. It was a relatively big group, with
some hailing from the US and two others from Switzerland (who interestingly
spoke the rare Romansh language and filled us in on all the details about it.)

The dishes bore a lot of resemblance to things we'd had and made in Spain, but
with some twists here and there. The kids enjoyed blending a gazpacho-like soup
and coiling up a fruit rolled cake.

{% include image.html caption="Family at the cooking class" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/cooking-class.jpg" %}

One of the treats that folks talk about in Portugal endlessly is pastel de nata.
These are tasty little egg custards in a flaky shell. Easily eaten in a couple
of bites, they're available all over the place. We found a pretty good location
for them near the Castelo Sao Jorge. Sadly, we had also just learned of Asher's
egg allergy not long before the trip, which took some of the shine off this
delectable treat.

{% include image.html caption="Pastel de Nata" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/pastel-de-nata.jpg" %}

One evening we went to a fado restaurant, which is a classical combination of
soulful folk music and good cooking. The spot we chose was probably among the
classier places we went on the trip, and the music was engaging even though we
couldn't follow the words which were undoubtedly fraught with meaning. The menu
had some lovely steak, pork cheeks, and duck. I also sampled the vinho verde, a
local vine variety made with newer grapes giving it a bright flavor.

Probably the highlight of our eating in Portugal, though, was [Cervejaria
Ramiro](https://www.cervejariaramiro.com/). Like many folks, we were aware of
this seafood restaurant through Anthony Bourdain who sang its praises for the
quality and freshness. He wasn't wrong. Although it had been many years since
Mr. Bourdain visited -- and the small spot depicted on the show had now burrowed
its way through room after room, level after level of the building it was in --
the seafood absolutely delivered. Much of it was offered by weight and there
were so many varieties of shellfish it was hard to know precisely what was being
picked, but what a lovely problem to have.

{% include image.html caption="Cervejaria Ramiro" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/tasty-seafood.jpg" %}

It wasn't uncommon for restaurants to have paper table covering that it was okay
to write and draw on. This led to a family hangman habit across the trip. That
led to a highlight of my life as a dad when I managed to Rickroll Cora. She then
proceeded to respond with games drawn from Monty Python. I may have my faults as
a parent, but I've done something right.

{% include image.html caption="Can you guess the hangman?" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/never-gonna-give-you-up.jpg" %}

## Farewell

That brought us to our final days in Lisbon and Europe for the summer. We
encountered then one of the downsides of apartments versus hotels, because our
flight wasn't until the afternoon but we had to leave at eleven. We asked around
at a couple of the hotels in the block, but they were rather uninterested in
holding bags when we hadn't taken a room out. Ah well.

{% include image.html caption="Not ready to leave" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/angry-fountain.jpg" %}

This led us to the airport many long hours early. We looked at the map and it
seemed that a park wasn't too far away, so the plan was for the ladies to hang
with the baggage while I took Asher to get his wiggles out before the long
flights began.

Sadly, like many US airports I'm sure, Lisbon had literally no way to walk to or
from the airport. We followed every path we could, but there was no way out
without walking on huge multi-lane roads that plainly weren't meant for
pedestrians. Defeated, we went back and rejoined the throng of people waiting
for their flights.

After that, the flight out was delayed back to Dublin where our primary
round-trip tickets were returning home from. We got in super late, and the kids
were on the verge of breaking down. We assumed that hunger was part of the
reason, but the only thing open was a chippy across the way. We bought a pile of
deeply fried, not that appetizing food. It went almost untouched because
everyone was so tired. At least we got a bit of sleep before hopping the flights
back home the next morning.
