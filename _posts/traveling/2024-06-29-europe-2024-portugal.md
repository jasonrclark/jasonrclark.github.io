## Lisbon

For years we'd heard great things about Portugal. Finally it was time to check
it out for ourselves!

We took a cab in from the airport and got our first blush of a problem when at
the end of the ride the driver insisted that there was some extra fee per
passenger. This hadn't been mentioned prior, but we were tired from the flight
and rolled with it. Turns out, things aren't quite as standardized and regulated
there as in Barcelona, so it's worth making sure they run the meter and not
letting that sort of stuff by.

The neighborhood where we'd rented an apartment was a little rundown but nothing
troubling. We schlepped our luggage upstairs in the tiny elevator. Everything
was in place, including a little garbage can beside the toilet and prominent
signs in multiple languages informing that you couldn't flush the TP. What?
Really? In Europe? This did indeed turn out to be the common state of the areas
we visited and not just a fault of this particular building's aging plumbing.

Another thing to note about Lisbon, though, were the many many hills. We're very
accustomed to walking places when we're traveling. A quick glance at the map
would often look like a reasonably short outing so we could avoid the cab
hassles. Almost without fail, though, any walk of more than a couple blocks
would be confronted by steep stairs climbing skyward, hills with charming if
ankle-threatening cobblestones, and a sheen of sweat by the time you arrived.

## Tiling

Lisbon was, on the whole, a more colorful city than we were used to in
Barcelona. A lot of architecture was vaguely similar, but with far more bright
paint to liven it up.

{% include image.html caption="Building with green tiles and a rounded end" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/tiling-building.jpg" %}

Even more distinctive, though, was the tiling which is typical of Portugal.
While not every building was fronted with various classic tile patterns, almost
any walk would reveal at least a couple.

In some areas, the tile was not merely with repeating patterns but with images
amongst the artistic geometry.

{% include image.html caption="More pictorial tiling" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/tiling-murals.jpg" %}

This was enough of a regional thing that many different tiles were sold in
tourist locations. Really intricate patterns could be seen inside and out in the
buildings. Given that Lisbon seemed a little run down at times, this use of tile
was a cool thing that counter-balanced what could have been a sort of dreary
urban setting.

## Castelo Sao Jorge

In the city, one of the major sights was the Castelo Sao Jorge which crouched up
on the top of a very tall hill. On our second day there, we started the hike up
though we were being frequently passed by small carts with padded seats, zipping
along to bring folks to the castle. We decided less than halfway up that this
was the better plan and when an empty cart asked if we wanted a ride we said
sure and hopped on.

In the outer courts of the castle, one of the most immediate points of interest
were a whole bunch of peacocks which roamed around free.

{% include image.html caption="lol" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/peakcocks-about.jpg" %}

It had been a while since we'd eaten when we arrived, so we grabbed some food
from the little outdoor cafe that was available near the entrance. This gave us
a chance to watch the peacocks... and to be watched very closely by them in
turn. They hovered endlessly around the area, clearly looking for a hand-out
which we were only too willing to provide.

{% include image.html caption="Asher feeding the peacocks" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/peacocks-feeding.jpg" %}

The castle contained a museum with history of the city and region. Along with
that, it also had a camera obscura in one of the tall towers. While I associate
these assemblies of lenses and mirrors that project an image with the distant
past, it turns out this one in Lisbon was only installed in 1998. It was a
pretty cool way to get a view of the city, though.

{% include image.html caption="Lisbon through the camera obscura" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/palace-camera-obscura.jpg" %}

As we were getting ready to go, there was a long set of stairs, the final
destination of which wasn't quite visible. Asher really wanted to see if it was
an exit, even though it wasn't marked as one. The gals stayed smartly up top,
but I trooped down with my energetic son, and guess what? It wasn't an exit, so
we climbed back up.

## Sintra

Our other big outing took us away from Lisbon to the town of Sintra. This
allowed us to visit not one but two interesting spots -- the [National Palace of
Pena](https://www.parquesdesintra.pt/en/parks-monuments/park-and-national-palace-of-pena/),
and the [Moorish
Castle](https://www.parquesdesintra.pt/en/parks-monuments/the-moorish-castle/).
We were thankfully able to book a driver through Bolt at a reasonable price,
even going between towns in this fashion.

{% include image.html caption="National Palace of Pena" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/palace.jpg" %}

The Palace was rather busy, with timed entry for folks, long lines for the buses
that made the final approach and people everywhere. However, it was an
impressive sight perched up on the hill, with bright yellow walls and
complicated stonework everywhere.

{% include image.html caption="Crowded exterior at the National Palace of Pena" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/palace-crowds.jpg" %}

The Palace was very much not an ancient castle, "only" dating from the 1850s.
This was evident in the size of many of the spaces, which were larger than I'm
used to seeing in older castles. It also showed up in the frequency with which
different chambers sported bathrooms, which must have been rather a luxury
innovation at the time. The interiors were lushly decorated, though, and it was
beautiful to tour through.

invited to stay." url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/palace-interior.jpg" %}

As we'd seen elsewhere, patterned tiling was in much evidence through the
National Palace.

{% include image.html caption="Tiled courtyard" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/palace-courtyard.jpg" %}

Downhill from the National Palace was the Moorish Castle. This felt far more
like a true castle, old enough to have fallen largely apart in many areas. We
walked down to it, through deeply forested hillsides.

{% include image.html caption="Woods near Sintra" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/woods-by-the-castle.jpg" %}

The day was actually rather cool, and coming to the castle that didn't get much
better as the winds kicked up with little of the castle body left in some areas
to block the breeze.

{% include image.html caption="Tree growing within the castle" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/tree-in-the-castle.jpg" %}

Perched as it was on a hill, the Moorish Castle used its surroundings to good
effect. This meant that the walls which you could climb up onto were not even
close to a simple flat rectangle. They swooped up and down in either direction,
following the folds of the hilltops.

{% include image.html caption="Stairs up" url="/images/travel/2024-Portugal/castle-stairs.jpg" %}

All the climbing was worth it, though, for the stunning view from the highest
points.

After we caught the Bolt back to Lisbon, we had it drop us off at the TimeOut
Market. We got there late enough the market portion of things was largely shut
down, but a huge open space there was devoted to many different food vendors so
we could all choose what we wanted. Following my meal, I tried out a sampler of
different ports which was lovely. My family meanwhile took advantage of the
gelato situation available. A massive screen in the center of the tall tables
set up for folks to eat at was showing the European Championships (France versus
Belgium while we were there, so no one got too rowdy.)
