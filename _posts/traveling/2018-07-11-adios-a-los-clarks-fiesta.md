At long last, the day has come... the Clarks are leaving for Barcelona (more on
that in a bit)!

To celebrate and connect with folks one last time before we go, we're throwing a
potluck picnic at Columbia Park. We'll bring soft drinks, some beer, and a fried
chicken main dish. If you're inclined bring something to share, but please come
hang out with us one last time!

There's a water feature and playground for kids, along with plenty of shade. We
recommend bringing something to sit on.
