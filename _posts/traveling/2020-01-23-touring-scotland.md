August broiled us day by day in Barcelona. My birthday was approaching at the
beginning of September, and Amber asked "Where would you like to go?"

The year prior we'd spent my birthday flying to San Francisco to finish our
paperwork for moving to Spain. Not exactly festive. This was a welcome
opportunity to actually, you know, celebrate! And answering the question of
where wasn't hard either--Scotland. Amber and I had visited before and wanted to
go back ever since. In recent years I've become a fan of single malt scotches,
so a distillery tour seemed in order.

## Good Crieff

But how do you balance visiting fine distilleries when you're traveling with
your kids? The first rule is "Everyone gets something." Fortunately we knew just
the thing. A few years back Amber and I went to [Scottish
Ruby](http://2014.scottishrubyconference.com/) at a Victorian spa called [Crieff
Hydro](https://www.crieffhydro.com/). This covered the kids perfectly, with
swimming, archery, horseback riding, and other activities. Excitement ran high.

We flew into Glasgow. As we landed, it was overcast and raining. No bother, as
Oregonians, we're used to this sort of thing right? We gathered our bags and
headed out the front door. The drizzle we'd observed turned into a hefty slap of
cold rain like we hadn't felt in months. Scuttling under the nearest shelter, we
dug out the coats we'd packed, but not worn, in Barcelona and headed to pick up
the rental car.

It became apparent after we got on the road that the kids would need food soon.
There's a certain tone to their voices that's unmistakable. Amber had heard
about a place called [Nando's](https://www.nandos.com/), a South African chain
known for its spicy peri-peri chicken. The first try and we were hooked; we've
gone to Nando's every time we're in the UK since. (For those wondering, I prefer
the moderate spice, while the rest of the family finds the mild quite enough
thank you).

With full bellies and less crankiness, we set off north. The first activity at
Crieff we'd signed up for--air rifle shooting, which Asher was greatly
anticipating--started at 4pm. Google Maps informed us that this was a stretch.
We arrived fifteen minutes late to the resort, hoping to still salvage the
situation, but matters got worse. As we talked to the front desk, we found that
all the activities we'd reserved online weren't showing up. (The room,
thankfully, wasn't impacted). We rescheduled archery for the next day, but sadly
the air-rifles and horses didn't happen. There was much wailing and gnashing of
teeth.

Between pools, arrows, a family-friendly dance concert each night, and a massive
chess set on the lawn, the family found Crieff perfect to kick the trip off.

## Distilleries

Our plan involved driving from Crieff in the central Scottish Highlands, up
north, then looping back south to catch our flight home in Manchester (cheap
tickets yo).

The country is littered with distilleries of all shapes and sizes. I did some
research and built a jam-packed itinerary that was obviously impossible for our
timeframe. That list served perfectly as a starting point, though.

The first stop was [Edradour](https://www.edradour.com/). We had visited years
before, with the full tour and a wonderful tasting afterward. Edradour has a
line of peaty scotches that they age in different wine barrels, everything from
port to Bordeaux. Sipping the same liquor aged differently, side by side, taught
me a ton about scotch. This time we enjoyed a nice selection in their tasting
room. They make two main lines--classic Edradour, and their newer peaty
Ballechin. We bought several bottles only available at the location (marked
SFTC, "straight from the cask").

[Cragganmore](https://www.malts.com/en-row/distilleries/cragganmore/) was the
second distillery we reached. Part of a larger company, their sampling room had
some rarer bottles from a variety of different lines. I came away with two very
nice bottles of their flagship product--one a 15 year, and another a special
150th anniversary edition only available at the distillery. (You may be
detecting a theme hereâ€¦)

The final big whisky location was not a distillery, but a whisky shop called
[The Whisky Castle](https://www.whiskycastle.com/). The shop is tucked away in a
tiny unassuming village called Tomintoul. This place is beautiful. The only time
I've seen more whisky in one location is in the beloved [Multnomah Whisky
Library](https://mwlpdx.com/) back in Portland. The Whiskey Castle runs a
wonderful tasting, including local favorites and a willingness to indulge
people's curiosity.

We settled into a small hotel nearby attached to a pub with an outsized scotch
collection. Amber and I had a lovely evening playing games, reading, and sipping
the good stuff in comfortable chairs while our children slept in the room across
the hall.

## Cairngorms National Park

Our drive took us through the central part of Scotland, which is largely
occupied by Cairngorms National Park. There we got to introduce the kids to some
of Scotland's lovely scenery. Along one stretch we passed by massive fields of
heather. Amber pulled the car over, and we all got out and flopped down on the
springy plants.

The kids and I trotted up a nearby hill. I was a little ways away when the kids
started eagerly calling me over. In a gravely spot, huddled up against the
blustery cool, was a toad.

Scotland was a lovely break, and I brought home a wonderful collection of
scotches to replace what I'd built up over years back in Portland. We loved
Scotland, and I'm sure we'll be back.
