After more than a decade, Amber and I were finally getting the chance to do some
extended travel without the kids.

## Getting To Athens

Our first major destination was
[Crete](/travel/2025/08/03/europe-2025-crete/), where we'd be attending
[JCrete](https://www.jcrete.org/). But one does not get to Crete direct from the
west coast of the United States. First stop, Athens.

We'd booked with Air Canada, which I'd traveled on before relatively happy. Not
too many weeks before the departure date, though, they cancelled a leg of our
flight. We had scheduled our classic super-duper early morning departure, but
when Amber scrambled on the computer to reschedule she ended up finding
something leaving the same day but mid-afternoon. It ended up losing a day,
which will be pertinent later, but was so much more comfortable.

The Portland Airport had some major renovations since the last time we'd been
through. The rather narrow check-in area had been knocked way back, making room
for a spacious modern layout underneath a ceiling of light wooden shapes that
felt very Portland. The drop-off had another major new aspect -- Cora drove us
up and dropped us off, as she was staying at home for the duration. Asher had
already left the day before and would be splitting time between the
grandparents, leaving Cora solo. It was such an odd feeling for my daughter to
be doing something so, well, grown up, but the time has come.

The trip itself was uneventful, as one hopes for with air travel. Our route went
Portland, Vancouver, Munich, Athens. The only minor hitch was in Munich where we
had to go through passport control. Beyond the stations where documents were
checked was a glassed in area with some doors marked plainly as "exit only" with
lots of red and signs. Yet apparently someone had decided after walking through
to turn back around and come _back_ through the doors. This set off alarms, and
everyone in the intervening space had to stand around in the shrill, piercing
noise for about fifteen minutes until some incomprehensible protocol had been
followed and we were allowed through.

With the late departure we ended up getting into Athens relatively late. A cab
dropped us downtown at our hotel, the Skylark. The air was thick and humid as we
got our luggage from the back. The hotel was definitely hipster tinged, mostly
in ways that made us Portlanders feel right at home.

The only off note in the hotel environment was in the elevator. It had a full
screen with a fancy purple geometric animation running in a loop, and played an
annoying dance beat. While the music itself grated a little, _it stopped the
music every time the doors opened before resuming at the same spot._ Any sense
of rhythm was entirely lost but hey, folks heading up to the "club" on the top
floor might have enjoyed it.

After we checked in it wasn't quite late enough to collapse. We keep a firm
policy of staying up until 9PM to start kicking the jetlag when travelling. We
found a little gyro spot around the corner, got the first of many Greek salads
with some fries but failed to order the meat we'd expected. We were so tired
that we didn't bother fixing it and just ate up before heading upstairs to
collapse.
