## Roadtripping

While I like to think that our family has a relatively international flair, we
definitely are suckers for at least one deep American trait -- the roadtrip.
Spending long hours in a car isn't something we dread. We enjoy it!

Given that, we decided to rent a car and travel across Spain from Bilbao to
Barcelona. This was about a six hour drive, which is somewhere in the mid-range
for us in a single day normally. From the relative greenery of Bilbao, it felt a
lot like the transition to Eastern Oregon going over the Cascade Mountains
moving in to drier parts of Spain.

As usual in our family, Amber drove. We found that there were a lot of well
stocked, nice rest stops along the way. We only had to pause at one for the kids
to blow of steam from an argument and made good time. There was traffic coming
into Barcelona late in the afternoon, but nothing too bad. The familiarity of
the city helped in finding our way to the place we were staying downtown.

## Favorites in BCN

The time in Barcelona was much less focused on sites and more on people. We
caught up with so many of our friends, it was amazing. Asher in particular got
to have sleepovers with his two besties who he'd been missing. They clicked just
like no time had passed -- Minecraft surpasses all boundaries of time and space.
I also was able to spend time with several former coworkers, some still with New
Relic, others not.

Of course, we also made it a point to visit our favorite locations across the
city was well. This meant multiple stops at places like [Dela
Crem](https://delacrem.cat/) -- the best gelato in Barcelona,
[Vinitus](https://www.laflautagroup.com/en) for incredible tapas, even an
evening at the [Green Room](https://www.greenroombarcelona.com/), the "Irish"
bar we often met friends at out in Poblenou.

Less fun, we dropped into our old bank in Poblenou. We'd kept the account there
with a little money in it, but when our phone numbers changed we lost access to
log in, and that could only be remedied in person. Oops! In classic
Spanish-banking style, it only took two and a half hour of mostly waiting to get
the issue resolved. ðŸ˜°

## San Juan

We happened to be in town with friends across the holiday of San Juan. This
celebration is made with fireworks and bonfires. Let me tell you, I thought
Americans were nuts about fireworks but the Spanish put us to shame! The size of
things folks are willing to set off in busy streets and beaches, the bonfires --
with fireworks being thrown into them... it was loud, boisterous, and I'm sure
injury-prone for some folks.

We stayed out in the streets after dark finally settled for some hours, keeping
a sensible distance from the most extreme while enjoying our own batch of
sparkly mayhem.

## Katana Experience

During an on-site in Barcelona with the Logging team that I was fortunate to be
able to fly back for, our manager Juanjo had planned an awesome activity -- the
[Katana Experience](https://samuraiexperience.es/en/). Ever since doing that
with my coworkers, I'd had it in mind for my son Asher, who is absolutely
obsessed with swords.

Things start off with getting dressed up in suitable outfits and learning about
the history of samurai. Then you get to practice with some wooden swords, very
nicely balanced and weighted.

At last, after all the preparations, you get to use the real katana. Those
blades are amazingly intimidating! So sharp, you can really feel the danger
holding them. With these you get to do some cuts with first a foam pool noodle,
and then with a rolled bamboo mat.

No huge surprise but Asher was the best of the crew at the actual cuts. He
didn't want to leave.

After the slicing with real swords, we switched back to practice blades now
buffered with foam and went to war with one another. Alliances were made and
broken, but we all came out laughing, sweating, and not too bruised.
