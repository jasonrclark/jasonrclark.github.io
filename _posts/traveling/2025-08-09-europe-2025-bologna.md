## Getting There

The flight from Athens to Bologna was a mixed bag. We were right up at the
front in the second row, and oddly one of the seats in the first row wasn't
present so I actually had leg room. But, being Ryanair, the boarding was
significantly delayed and people were cranky. Amber also felt unusually
nauseated on the plane. She gets motion sick pretty easily, but we were glad to
hit the ground in Bologna.

It was hot when we got outside and found a late taxi. By this point it was a
little after midnight, and we showed the driver our address. He shook his head.
"Sundays, the center of city is closed. I can't drive all the way there."
Nervously we agreed for him to take us as close as he could manage, imagining as
we did schlepping a kilometer with our three big bags in tow over cobblestones.
Fortunately, it turned out to only be about three or four blocks from where the
Sunday only-walking zone kicked in to our apartment.

We buzzed in and very tall, old looking wooden doors swung open to us. Amber had
received a PDF file with multiple pages of instructions in colorful text and
separate numbered boxes. We managed to find the cabinet of lock boxes to get the
key, but for several minutes couldn't figure out which one was ours. Tired, hot,
and frazzled, it felt like an escape room puzzle box. Eventually we reviewed the
sheet again and found where the lock box number was listed after trying the code
unsuccessfully on about half of them.

The elevator up to our flat was painted a bright red color. Unlike almost any
elevator I've ever been in, the instant you pressed the button for your floor,
the doors started slamming closed. This proved to be a fun game for us
throughout the time pretending we'd shut the door out on each other.

The flat was up on the fifth floor, with a nice open plan and wood
floors and the bed up on a loft. The appliances were all new, and it looked
pretty apparent that this was a pure rental, not someone's actual apartment.
Also it was rather steamy being on the top and exposed to sunlight during the
day. The instructions asked to keep AC use to a minimum, but it was hard to keep
the temperature liveable at all as it turned out Bologna was facing a heatwave
that week. So much for cooling down a little post Crete!

The artwork in the apartment was an odd mix. There was a large painting of an
angel who looked either in ecstasy or about ready to pass out. Beside it were a
couple of prints that looked to be from Alaska. Nice bookshelves lined the walls
with a healthy selection of travel related books and random Italian volumes.

We flopped down into the bed as soon as it got cool enough, glad to have arrived
at the next stage of our journey.

## Eats

- Refused at first restaurant — kinda rude? Lucked out without reservation. Zucchini blossoms don’t taste like much?
- Simoni salumeria dinner
- Vicolo Colombiana for dinner so great
- Trattoria da Me. Awesome meal. Boisterous waiter. Zucchini flower, rabbit, lasagna, tomatoes. Not super traditional at all but so good.
