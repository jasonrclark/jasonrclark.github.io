## Checking In

We landed in Dublin in late morning, having slept very little on the flight. Our
game plan in Dublin involved day excursions outside of the city, so on after
customs we headed for the rental car pickup. Amber is our main driver most of
the time anyway (reinforced by a combination of her car-sickness and my vision
issues), but especially when we're in left-drive countries.

Unfamiliar as yet with the GPS in the car, we navigated via phone to our hotel,
the Skylon. Honestly nothing super special but it had rooms with three beds, was
well placed between the airport and the city, and (for a small fee) had parking.

By this time a small problem from our launch on another continent had emerged --
Cora had slipped on Amber's Birkenstock's instead of her sneakers when we left
home. This wouldn't have been a big issue except those were meant to be her
walking shoes... for the next three weeks. Off to the shopping center we went!

It turned out to be not a bad errand for keeping us all awake, as our goal was
to stay up until nine o'clock to get our rhythms set. Helpful hotel folks sent
us to the Jervis Shopping Centre, a pretty basic mall setup settled in a
shopping quarter of the city which gave plenty of options for getting Cora's
feet adequately covered.

As a bonus, it was also near a Nando's, one of our favorite restaurants to hit
when we're in the British Isles. Although appetites were mixed around 4pm, it
filled bellies enough to last the rest of the day as it happened. We each
wandered off at one point or another to the restrooms, with Asher leaving for a
particularly long stint. When he came back he admitted to zoning out and almost
falling asleep on the pot, a sentiment we could all agree with.

Back to the hotel we settled in to relax and get some rest. I sat up reading a
while but somewhat out of characters fell asleep in that posture too, waking
with a little jump-scare and a vigorous snorting, snoring noise that had
everyone else laughing. Jet-lag notwithstanding, everyone was conked out pretty
well by 9pm and slept decently through until morning.
