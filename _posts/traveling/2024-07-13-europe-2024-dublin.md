## Checking In

We landed in Dublin in late morning, having slept very little on the flight. Our
game plan in Dublin involved day excursions outside of the city, so on after
customs we headed for the rental car pickup. Amber is our main driver most of
the time anyway (reinforced by a combination of her car-sickness and my vision
issues), but especially when we're in left-drive countries.

Unfamiliar as yet with the GPS in the car, we navigated via phone to our hotel,
the Skylon. Honestly nothing super special but it had rooms with three beds, was
well placed between the airport and the city, and (for a small fee) had parking.

By this time a small problem from our launch on another continent had emerged --
Cora had slipped on Amber's Birkenstock's instead of her sneakers when we left
home. This wouldn't have been a big issue except those were meant to be her
walking shoes... for the next three weeks. Off to the shopping center we went!

It turned out to be not a bad errand for keeping us all awake, as our goal was
to stay up until nine o'clock to get our rhythms set. Helpful hotel folks sent
us to the Jervis Shopping Centre, a pretty basic mall setup settled in a
shopping quarter of the city which gave plenty of options for getting Cora's
feet adequately covered.

As a bonus, it was also near a Nando's, one of our favorite restaurants to hit
when we're in the British Isles. Although appetites were mixed around 4pm, it
filled bellies enough to last the rest of the day as it happened. We each
wandered off at one point or another to the restrooms, with Asher leaving for a
particularly long stint. When he came back he admitted to zoning out and almost
falling asleep on the pot, a sentiment we could all agree with.

Back to the hotel we settled in to relax and get some rest. I sat up reading a
while but somewhat out of characters fell asleep in that posture too, waking
with a little jump-scare and a vigorous snorting, snoring noise that had
everyone else laughing. Jet-lag notwithstanding, everyone was conked out pretty
well by 9pm and slept decently through until morning.

## Guinness, Natural History, and Seafood

Our first activity in Dublin was a tour of the Guinness factory. In a trend that
would become evident on the trip, this was a timed entry that Amber had
purchased tickets for ahead of time to smooth the path. The approach to the
factory looked honestly very much like a working sort of industrial place, just
with more brick and cobblestone than I'm used to. You could totally imagine the
place being in active use.

Once we'd queued outside, though, you quickly knew that the interior was
something entirely different. QR code readers and folks with computers were
there to check folks in in an orderly fashion. Groups were made by time of entry
and steadily flowed with great efficiency. We found ourselves walking through
spaces that explained the brewing process with great animations and immersive
exhibits. Here and there elements of the old factory look sneaked through,
though.

Whole floors of the place were devoted to the wide ranging advertising empire of
Guinness. As an American, this was interesting though not at all nostalgic as
little to none of that advertising really broke into my world at all. It was
fascinating to see how it evolved over time, though, and how often they used art
and styles which were strikingly modern for a brand from the 1700s.

The final stage of the tour went to the very tippy top of the whole place, which
had two different bar areas both entirely done up in floor to ceiling windows.
Different meaningful locations were marked on the glass in such a way that you
could see the place and read about it at the same time -- really nice trick to
use the lovely views. Each adult member of the party (so two of us) got a ticket
for a pint. Sadly, Amber isn't drinking alcohol in this season so I had to take
care of both for us.

After the Guinness we took a nice long walk to circle by a couple of spots Amber
wanted to shop at. The first was a chain of stores I'd never heard of called
[Avoca](https://www.avoca.com) which sported a lot of nice clothing, home goods,
and tasty treats. Asher was about as happy to hang around there as you'd expect
any thirteen year-old boy to be. From there we visited a smaller art store
called [Irish Design Shop](https://irishdesignshop.com/). We bought a really
nice print for our wall at home, and enjoyed the artistry. Next door a furniture
store had a hipster-ish coffee spot, so I grabbed a flat white to stave off some
of the afternoon jet lag sluggishness.

After the shopping we got back to the sightseeing with the [Natural History
branch of National Museum of
Ireland](https://www.museum.ie/en-IE/Museums/Natural-History). Now the kids
always love a good natural history museum anyways, but this one was special as
it was kind of a relic of the Victorian era. Rather than glossy huge exhibits
with animation and vibrant colors, it was case after case of taxidermied animals
with varying degrees of believability.

I was a little surprised with how much the kids took to the uniqueness of the
space. They searched out their favorite types of animals -- frogs for Cora,
turtles for Asher, with plenty of zooming around taking photos with their phones
in between.

Plenty of the exhibits were a little newer, gathered throughout the 1900s. The
insect cases all seemed very realistic and well taken care of (as my childhood
entomologist enjoyed seeing). But not everything was quite so, well, successful
in its preservation.

Dinner that evening was one of the reasons we'd taken the car for rental.
[Cavistons](https://cavistons.com/restaurant/) is well to the south of Dublin,
and would have been quite a stretch to get to from downtown without a lot of
hassle. We punched the directions into the GPS in the car this time and happily
watched the city sweep by. Well, up until that one turn anyways. Now remember,
it was the end of our second day in country, and the jet lag at that point is
rather heavy. We've had a full day, and honestly are a little scattered. Amber
started to take a left turn at a light and, as she has thousands of times,
headed for the rightmost lane.

"Drive left. Hon, drive left. DRIVE. LEFT."

She recovered in plenty of time, though not enough to save the kids from a
reasonable startle. "I don't want to die," Asher said as we drove further along,
mostly in jest.

The meal was lovely, the seafood fresh and just what we were hoping for. The
atmosphere was a little fancy, but not so much that we couldn't pull out some
mini Uno cards while we waited. All in all, a successful day.
