<h1 class="post-title">Kids Coding<i class="fa fa-child"></i></h1>

<p>Since sometime in 2013, I've been coding with my daughter, Coraline. When we
started she was about 5 years old, quite a bit younger than a lot of folks
start thinking about coding with their kids. I've found it to be a rewarding
experience, though, and if you have young children in your life I'd encourage
you to find ways to get them creating on computers instead of just consuming as
soon as possible!</p>

<p>I'm grateful to <a href="http://cascadiaruby.com">Cascadia Ruby</a> for
giving me the opportunity to speak on this topic at their 2014 conference.</p>

<p>Video of the presentation is available on
