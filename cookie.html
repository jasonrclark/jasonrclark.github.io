        <h1>Cookie Testing</h1>
        <p>This page is investigating how CHIPS support is working to set partitioned cookies from an iframe. Busted on Safari 18.5.</p>
        <p>First time loading on this won't show anything but may set the cookie. Later reloads of the frame will show the cookies we've set so go ahead and smash that refresh button.</p>
        <p>If you eventually get cookies on a later refresh in the frame, your settings will allow preview to work. If not, no dice.</p>
