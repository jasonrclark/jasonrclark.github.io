<h1 class="post-title">Speaking <i class="fa fa-comment"></i></h1>

<p>Since 2013 I've been speaking at Ruby conferencs, and loving it. Getting up
in front a bunch of people who love technology and talking about cool things
I've discovered is way more fun than I'd ever have imagined.</p>

<p>And even better, these days the fine folks at
<a href="http://confreaks.com">Confreaks</a>, among others, are
making sure those talks are available for anyone who couldn't make the conf. I
hope you find something of value in these videos!</p>

<p>Slides for all my presentations, even those that weren't videoed, are
available <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jasonrclark">on Speakerdeck.</a></p>
